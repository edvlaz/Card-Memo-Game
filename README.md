# Card-Memo-Game
This is my Memory Card Game code, still not done :(
 This is My Card Memory Project  for Udacity. In this proje t i was asked to make a card matching game, i was given the 
 basic lines of code to start such as HTML and CSS.
 
HOW DOES IT WORK?
When you click a card it will show an icon, and when you click another card it will display its value
and if the cards value is the same icon ' it will be a match!!'. If not the cards will flip back and hide the icon.
